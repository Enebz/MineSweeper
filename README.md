# Mineweeper
Minesweeper is an old, yet amusing game that was first released in 1989.
Over 30 years later, I have decided to remake the popular game from scratch (almost).

## How to play
- Objective: Don't blow up!
- Left click to reveal a tile
- Right click to flag a tile
- Middle click to reveal adjacent tiles which are not flagged
- Numeric tiles tell you how many adjacent tiles contain a bomb

## Texturepack support
The game supports a texutres.png file which is 512px x 512px large.
This is the default one. Download and edit it as you wish.

## Download
I am not updating this, so I reccomend you to build the project yourself.
Download the minesweeper [here](https://github.com/Enebz/MineSweeper/archive/refs/tags/1.0.zip).

## Build
I built this with Visual Studio, however you may build this in whatever way you want.
